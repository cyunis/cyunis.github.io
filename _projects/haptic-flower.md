- **Payload Capacity**: 5kg
- **Repeatability**: ±0.02mm
- **Degrees of Freedom**: 6-axis
- **Maximum Speed**: 180°/s (joint speed)
- **Control System**: Custom real-time controller with EtherCAT communication
- **Vision System**: 
  - 2x 4K industrial cameras
  - Structured light 3D scanner
  - Custom ML-based object recognition
- **End Effectors**: 
  - Pneumatic gripper
  - Vacuum suction cup array
  - Precision screwdriver

## Development Process

The development of this robotic arm involved:

1. **Mechanical Engineering**: Design and simulation of the arm structure, joint mechanisms, and end effectors.
2. **Electronics Design**: Development of custom motor drivers, sensor integration, and safety systems.
3. **Control System**: Implementation of inverse kinematics, trajectory planning, and real-time control algorithms.
4. **Computer Vision**: Development of object recognition, pose estimation, and quality control systems.
5. **Integration**: Combining all subsystems and calibrating for precision operation.

## Challenges and Solutions

A significant challenge was achieving the required precision while maintaining a reasonable cost. This was addressed by using high-quality servo motors with custom gearboxes and developing a sophisticated calibration procedure that compensates for mechanical imperfections.

Another challenge was developing a reliable vision system that could work under varying lighting conditions. I implemented a multi-spectral approach with controlled lighting and developed adaptive algorithms that can adjust to environmental changes.

## Results

The robotic arm achieved a 98% success rate in assembly tasks, with cycle times reduced by 35% compared to previous methods. The system's flexibility allows it to be quickly reprogrammed for different tasks, making it ideal for small-batch production environments.

## Future Improvements

- Implementation of force feedback for delicate assembly operations
- Integration with collaborative features for human-robot cooperation
- Cloud connectivity for remote monitoring and programming
- Expanded library of end effectors for specialized tasks
