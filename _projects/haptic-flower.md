## Project Overview

This project consisted of a blanket and flower with ERM's that provided haptic vibration feedback and was designed for use by disabled dancers with the feedback controlled via a GUI by a choreographer. The system is designed to be used during live performances and can also play preprogrammed signals. This work was funded by the Touch Aesthetics Fellowship at ASU NEM as part of the Leonardo CripTech Incubator.

## Technical Specifications

- **Radius of flower**: 60cm
- **Number of ERM (eccentric rotating motor)**: 16
- **Control System**: Arduino Uno with PCA9685 motor controller
- **GUI System**: Unity custom application 

## Development Process

The development of this haptic flower was done in a team of four, by members Vanessa Cruz, Selwa Sweiden, and Premankur Banerjee. The components of this project I worked on included:

1. **Mechanical Design**: Visual design of system and haptic sketching with various materials to match criteria of weight, flexibility and size
2. **Electronics Design**: Designing circuit layout, soldering electronics together and debugging
3. **Integration**: Combining all subsystems and designing test cases

## Challenges and Solutions

A significant challenge was the timeline for this project. From start to finish, this project was conceived and built in a period of two weeks. This required intense communication and collaboration across all team members. 

In addition, the hardware was going to be used in a live performance so it had to work. We tested individual components and assembly techniques with a single petal, before committing to building the whole flower. 

## Results

The crip haptic flower techno jam worked on its first debut in a live performance and was able to be used for two user studies after that. A paper will be submitted to Transactions on Haptics for a special Arts track. 

## Future Improvements

- Improving the durability of the wiring 
- Creating additional flowers to have more than one available for use during performance
