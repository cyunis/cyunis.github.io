## Project Overview

This autonomous delivery robot was designed to navigate indoor environments and deliver packages to designated locations. The robot uses a combination of LIDAR, computer vision, and ultrasonic sensors to create a map of its environment and navigate safely around obstacles.

## Technical Specifications

- **Dimensions**: 60cm x 40cm x 50cm
- **Weight**: 15kg (unloaded), 25kg (max capacity)
- **Battery**: 24V LiFePO4, 20Ah capacity
- **Runtime**: 8 hours of continuous operation
- **Payload Capacity**: 10kg
- **Navigation**: SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- **Sensors**: 
  - 360Â° LIDAR
  - 4x Ultrasonic distance sensors
  - 2x RGB cameras with depth sensing
  - IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
- **Connectivity**: WiFi, Bluetooth, 4G LTE
- **Processor**: NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX

## Development Process

The development of this robot involved several phases:

1. **Mechanical Design**: CAD modeling and simulation of the chassis, wheel configuration, and cargo compartment.
2. **Electronics Integration**: Design of power distribution, sensor integration, and motor control systems.
3. **Software Development**: Implementation of navigation algorithms, obstacle avoidance, and path planning.
4. **Testing and Iteration**: Extensive testing in various environments to refine the robot's behavior.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was developing a robust navigation system that could handle dynamic environments with moving obstacles. I implemented a hybrid approach combining traditional SLAM techniques with deep learning-based object detection to predict the movement of people and other moving objects.

Another challenge was optimizing the battery life while maintaining performance. This was addressed by implementing power management algorithms that adjust the robot's behavior based on battery level and mission requirements.

## Results

The robot successfully completed over 500 deliveries in a test environment with a 98% success rate. It demonstrated the ability to navigate through crowded spaces, use elevators, and handle unexpected obstacles. The average delivery time was reduced by 45% compared to manual delivery methods.

## Future Improvements

- Integration with building management systems for automatic elevator control
- Fleet management capabilities for coordinating multiple robots
- Enhanced human-robot interaction through natural language processing
- Improved object recognition for more complex environments
