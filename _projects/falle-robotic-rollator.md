## Project Overview

Walker use is associated with falls, which is a scary possibility for users. To learn more about causes of falls, this autonomous experimental robot was designed to disrupt user's balance while they are walking to mimic scenarios that could potentially cause falls. The walker provides motorized accelerations and collects data in tandem with a motion capture system.

## Technical Specifications

- **Dimensions**: 65cm x 79cm x 60cm
- **Weight**: 8kg (unloaded), 200kg (max capacity)
- **Battery**: 18.5V 5S 50C 5000mAh capacity Lipo
- **Runtime**: Typically 2-4 hours, can go up to 8 hours without charge
- **Sensors**: 
  - 4x Button load cells
  - 2x Hall effect encoders in wheels
  - Teensy 4.1 clock
- **Actuators**:
  - 2x DC brushless hub motors
- **Microcontroller**: Teensy 4.1

## Development Process

The development of this robot involved several phases:

1. **Mechanical Design**: Handle extensions, CAD modeling and construction of the load cell housings and motor mounting blocks, assembly.
2. **Electronics Integration**: Design of circuit, sensor integration and testing, motor control systems, enclosure design and assembly in basket.
3. **Software Development**: Implementation of sensing, perturbation generation, data collection, real time behavior.
4. **Testing and Iteration**: Extensive testing to refine the robot's behavior and experimental protocols.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was creating a robot that could provide perturbations to disrupt balance by accelerations of the rollator while walking that could mimic encounters in real life. I implemented control that was sensitive to the user's response, including gain scheduling of additional loading on the rollator that would interfere with the PI control.

Another challenge was providing auditory feedback that could instruct users to maintain a certain level of weight on the rollator during use. This was tested with extensive piloting and sound design was adjusted to be usable over a 2 hour period without annoyance.

## Results

This robot was successfully used for several experiments with human participants to study how balance disruptions generated by FALL-E would affect walking biomechanics. Results are currently being written up for publication.

## Future Improvements

- More automated battery and power control 
- Safety features for rollator users to use at home
- Adaption of the control to provide assistance, not resistance
- Improved load cell amplifiers to provide more frequent updates to measured load
