## Project Overview

This project was contracted on behalf of a blind individual who wanted an alternative to the white cane for walking while outside. The goals of the project were to make a wearable device that wasn't noticeable as a disability tool, and used lidar cameras for sensing while providing force based feedback. The design and project requirements were conceived in collaboration with the user, while the building and testing was completed by me.

## Development Process

The development process included:

1. **Design and Project Requirements**: Developed with an initial interview over the phone, refined after I sent back sketches and a draft of technical requirements.
2. **Building**: Building was implemented on each subsystem separately, ensuring that haptics worked before starting on computer vision, and that all hardware was viable to be integrated into one circuit that could be modified for next version prototypes.
3. **Testing**: Conducted with the user in person and incorporating feedback that was feasible within the week long window of testing.
4. **Conclusion**: Documentation and prototype were provided to the user along with code and protocols on how to use this in one virtual package.

## Challenges and Solutions

This prototype was designed before ever meeting the user in person, and with the expectation that it could be developed for personal, business or research use cases. Thus there was a challenge to balance future plans for the project by not only making something new without the chance for in person testing along the way, along with creating an easily iterable design that could be adapted by future engineers. Frequent calls and check ins along the way provided chances to weigh which features were important to include and testing was handled by making the modules as robust as possible in benchtop testing and providing sufficient in person testing to allow time for some modifications as needed.
