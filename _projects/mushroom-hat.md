## Project Overview

This project was created for the Functional Fashion competition at International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems. Our goal was to make an easily donned and doffed, durable wearable that can recognize an agent and its level of entrance within a 50 cm radius of a person. We designed the response to be functional, effective and fabulous to and welcome the agent encroaching in the personal space in a playful manner. It was co-designed with Dr. Nathan Dennler. The mushroom design was inspired by the bridal veil stinkhorn mushroom (Phallus indusiatus).

Here is a demo of the prototype showing the main feature, the increasing movement of the hat mesh when a person gets closer:

## Technical Specifications

- **Height of hat including veil**: 1m
- **Weight of hat**: 2 kg
- **Number of servo motors**: 2
- **Control System**: Adafruit Feather M0 with Wifi
- **Sensors**: IR range finders

## Development Process

The development of this mushroom hat was done in a team of two, with myself and Dr. Nathan Dennler. The components of this project I worked on included:

1. **Mechanical Design**: Visual design of system and haptic sketching with various materials to match criteria of weight, flexibility and size
2. **Material Selection**: Choice of fabric materials and structural elementss

## Challenges and Solutions

A significant challenge was that we were in different locations while building this. This led to a natural split of the hardware and software subsystems by our expertise. In order to test mechanism design, smaller pieces of the final result were used, and weight estimates were made based on the performance of the test prototype.

## Results

We won third place in the Functional Fashion contest and created a wearable device that is functional, effective and fabulous at inviting nearby people in.
